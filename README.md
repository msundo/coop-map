yarn install
```
2. Start local webserver
```sh
yarn run dev
```
That's it! ðŸ™Œ

##  Build

To generate a production build: run the command `yarn build` â€” it will build the project, minify scripts and stylesheets and [generally optimize](https://webpack.js.org/guides/production/) the solution for production.

The output folder is `./dist`.

The following scripts and stylesheets will be generated:
* `polyfills.js`
* `main.js`
* `main.css`

as described in the `package.json` files field.
